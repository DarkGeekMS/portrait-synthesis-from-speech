In this chapter, we discuss our working pipeline and system architecture in details.  Generally, our system takes a speech note, textual description or numerical attributes as an input. It processes the input description and outputs the initial human face portrait that corresponds to the given description. Afterwards, the user is allowed to manually control some facial attributes and morphological features and to rotate the face and render it in multiple poses. In the first section, we give an overview about the final system. Then, we discuss the final system architecture in the second section. In the subsequent sections, each module implementation is discussed in details. In the last section, we discuss the other conducted experiments, why we choose this final system and suggestions that can possibly improve the other experiments.

\subsection{Overview and Assumptions}

As mentioned above, our system basically enables the user to describe a human face in words or using numerical values and turns it into a full human face portrait that can be manipulated and rendered in multiple poses. The system relies heavily on generative models and text processing, both are iteratively designed to obtain the required results. The overall flow can be described as follows :
\begin{itemize}
    \item The input speech notes are translated to text.
    \item The textual description (extracted from speech input or manually entered) is processed to extract the numerical values of the required facial features.
    \item The numerical values are used to generate a face embedding vector that encodes the facial attributes in low dimensional space ($512D$).
    \item A generative model is specifically designed to translate from the low dimensional embedding into the full face portrait ($1024X1024$).
    \item The generated face portrait can be further refined by navigating the face embedding space and re-generating the face portrait.
    \item Once the user settles on the final face portrait, the system can render that face in multiple poses to provide further identification.
\end{itemize}

The previous flow provides a very versatile framework to generate face portrait and adjust it to your liking. However, there is an extremely large number of facial attributes and morphological features to describe a human face. Consequently, we have to choose a descriptive subset of these attributes to consider in the face description. We consider $32$ facial attributes for face description, which are listed as follows :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Overall face :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gender : Male / Female.
        \item Age : Young / Old.
        \item Thickness : Chubby / Slim.
        \item Shape : Oval / Circular.
        \item Skin Color : Black / White.
        \item Cheeks : Normal / Rosy.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Eyes :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Color : Black / Blue / Green / Brown.
        \item Width : Wide / Narrow.
        \item Eyebrows : Light / Bushy.
        \item Bags Under Eyes : On / Off.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Nose :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Size : Big / Small.
        \item Pointy : On / Off.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Ears :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Size : Big / Small.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Jaw :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mouth Size : Big / Small.
        \item Lips Size : Big / Small.
        \item Cheekbones : Low / High.
        \item Double Chin : On / Off.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Hair :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Color : Black / Blonde / Brown / Red / Gray.
        \item Length : Tall / Short.
        \item Style : Straight / Curly / Receding Hairline / Bald / with Bangs.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Facial Hair :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Beard / None.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Race :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item White / Black / Asian.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Accessories :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Glasses : Sight / Sun.
        \item Makeup : On / Off.
        \item Lipstick : On / Off.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Architecture}

Now, let's discuss our system architecture. The system consists of $6$ modules, $3$ core modules of the project and $3$ auxiliary modules. These modules are deployed in a \emph{web application} to provide an easy-to-use interface for face generation and manipulation. Figure \ref{fig:system} shows the complete block diagram of the system architecture. Meanwhile, figure \ref{fig:app} shows the application design and how the modules are deployed in a web application. The \emph{core} modules are listed as follows :
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Text Processing :} processes the input textual description and extracts the corresponding numerical values of facial attributes. This problem is similar to \emph{multi-label text classification}, however the outputs are normalized scores of facial attributes, which are designed carefully to match the \emph{face code generation} process.
    \item \textbf{Face Generation :}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Code Generation :} converts the numerical attributes values to be low dimensional face embedding. This is the most \emph{important} and \emph{innovative} module of our system, because it glues the desired attributes scored with the latent space of the generative model (used to generate the face), resulting in more accurate quality outputs.
        \item \textbf{Code-to-Face Translation :} translates the low dimensional face embedding into the actual face portrait. For this purpose, we use \texttt{StyleGAN2}, which is a \emph{state-of-art latent-based generative model}, whose latent space can be manipulated easily to fit our needs.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Meanwhile, the \emph{auxiliary} modules are listed as follows :
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Speech Recognition :} translates the input speech to textual description.
    \item \textbf{Face Refinement :} uses the same generative model to manually refine the generated face portrait through navigating the latent space.
    \item \textbf{Multiple Head Poses Generation :} rotates the generated face portrait and renders it into multiple poses.
\end{itemize}

We discuss each module in more details in the subsequent sections. Also, these modules are organized into a web application for easier usage, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:app}. The application is divided into :
\begin{itemize}
    \item\textbf{ Web (Frontend) :} which contains the user interface and, also, the \emph{speech recognizer}. The speech recognizer is moved to the frontend to reduce the network communication overhead between the web application and the server, as transmitting text is easier than transmitting speech. Moreover, the speech recognizer doesn't require high computational power, so it can be embedded in the web application.
    \item \textbf{Server (Backend) :} which is separated into two servers. First server contains the \emph{text processor} and the \emph{generative model} and serves the requests of face generation and refinement. Second server contains the \emph{pose generator} and serves the requests of face rotation.
\end{itemize}

The two servers can communicate with each other to exchange the generated face portraits through \texttt{TCP sockets}. Meanwhile, the web application communicates and sends requests to the servers through \texttt{HTTP REST API}.
