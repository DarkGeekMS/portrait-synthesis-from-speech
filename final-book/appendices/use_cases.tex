As mentioned before, our application can be used in police station or any organization responsible for missing people like International Center for Missing and Exploited Children and many other organizations.
Also, Archaeological and Historical Researchers will be willing to use our app as it will help them to identify the facial description on the mummies using images not only textual descriptions.
