\subsection{Technical Feasibility}

To conduct this project knowledge base in the field of image processing and mathematics is required, to build on the knowledge in artificial intelligence, the use of generative adversarial networks and supervised learning to build and improve the models. Also, experience in web design and launching to represent our product to any user or organization, so that they buy it. We used our devices to train the models besides the online free service, such as \emph{Google Colab}. Additionally most of the developed models were guided by published research papers, therefore indicating and emphasizing the feasibility of the solution.

\subsection{Operational Feasibility}

As mentioned before, we deal with two types of users. One uses the application for special purposes; finding missing people or identifying the image of some ancient king or queen, so they need to have at least one PC with VRAM 11GB or more, to be able to run the application which will cost around \$1500 to \$2000 or more depends on the number of PCs will be used and their specifications. For the other type of users we can deploy the app for free as a trial, then a little expense is asked from subscribed users so that the deployment cost is covered with profits. 

\subsection{Legal Feasibility}

The development of the project depends on publicly available libraries and software tools, like \emph{PyTorch}, \emph{OpenCV}, \emph{Flask} and \emph{VueJS}. All the pretrained models used are open sources and legal to be used for any product. All datasets used to train any written model are public for any commercial use or made by us. The devices used to train those models are our own or on \emph{Google Colab}, which is also public for any use.
