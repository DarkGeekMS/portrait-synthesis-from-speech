# Face Generation From Text (Staged)

This folder contains the main code for `staged` experiments _(separate modules)_ of `face generation from text`. Two different approaches are considered :

-   `axes matrix-based generation` : in which random faces are generated, then classified using _multi-label_ classifier to be used to fit a _feature axes matrix_.

-   `directions-base generation` : in which feature directions are developed using different methods and then used to manipulate the latent space.

## Installation

-   Install requirements in main `README.md`.
